## Visualisation
If you want to draw your graph on the screen, please provide two files to the ```GraphWeightsVisualization.py```. One with the incidence matrix and the second - with weights. Let the weights be one in each line, in the same order which is presented in the first file.
For example:
``` 
python3 GraphWeightsVisualization.py MacierzIncydencji.txt WektorWag.txt
```
